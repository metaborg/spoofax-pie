# Spoofax 3

--8<-- "docs/_include/_all.md"

Spoofax 3 is a _modular_ and _incremental_ textual language workbench running on the JVM: a collection of tools and Java libraries that enable the development of textual languages, embeddable into batch compilers, code editors and IDEs, or custom applications.
It is a reimplementation of [Spoofax 2]( https://www.spoofax.dev/), with the goal of being more modular, flexible, and correctly incremental.

This documentation website aims to cover language development with Spoofax 3, development of the language workbench itself (e.g., meta-language development), and development of this documentation.

Currently, Spoofax 3 is experimental and still a work-in-progress.
Therefore, it does not have a stable API, lacks documentation and test coverage, and has not yet been applied to real-world use cases.
If you are looking for a more mature alternative, see [Spoofax 2]( https://www.spoofax.dev/), which Spoofax 3 is based on.
