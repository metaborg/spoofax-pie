3. check if there is a bug report related to your question in the [Spoofax 3 issue tracker](https://github.com/metaborg/spoofax-pie/issues?q=is%3Aissue) by searching. Also check closed issues, as they may provide an answer to your question. If there is an open issue related to your question, continue discussion on that issue.
