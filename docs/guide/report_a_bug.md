# Report a bug

Before reporting a bug:

1. check if there is an existing bug report in the [Spoofax 3 issue tracker](https://github.com/metaborg/spoofax-pie/issues?q=is%3Aissue) by searching. Also check closed issues, as the bug may already be fixed or closed for other reasons. If there is already an open issue for the bug, continue discussion on that issue.

Report the bug by creating a [new issue in the Spoofax 3 issue tracker](https://github.com/metaborg/spoofax-pie/issues/new/choose).
Make sure to fill in the template, and to be comprehensive and detailed, to make it easier for us to resolve the bug report.

The [troubleshooting guide](eclipse_lwb/troubleshooting.md) can help you with getting exception stack traces, logs, thread dumps, and heap dumps. Please include these with the bug report if you think they are applicable.
