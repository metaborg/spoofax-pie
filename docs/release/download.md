## Development version

The development version of Spoofax is always `{{release.dev.version}}`.

Development versions of Spoofax use snapshot versioning, meaning that they always point to the latest build that is made whenever a change is pushed to Spoofaxâ€™s repositories. Therefore, older builds are not available since they are continuously replaced by newer builds. We do not recommend usage of the development version unless you absolutely need its features, want to help us test, or if you know what you are doing.
